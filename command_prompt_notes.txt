Command Prompt Concept



Take in a command word -> Do something with it depending on its value


ls -> two characters -> ASCII chars are 1 byte each. I can store 4 bytes in a register

Up to 4 chars per command is the simplest before I have to start using more registers and/or reading from memory

ls, cp, mv, etc.


Prompt loop:

Read character -> If not enter key, record character in command register
Read character -> If 0, we're still waiting for the next character, so try again. If not enter key, record character in command register shifted up +8 bits
Read character -> If value is `0` we're still waiting for next character, so try again. If not enter key, record character in command register shifted up +16 bits
Read character -> If value is `0` we're still waiting for next character, so try again.If not enter key, record character in command register shifted up +24 bits
Read character -> If enter key, process command word. If not enter key, idk lol push current command register to RAM and begin new chunk.

We'll need some register to track how many words our command contains, so we know to grab those words from RAM as they're needed.

I guess we'll need for it to recognize words in a binary tree kind of way to know which direction to go?



command: ls -> 
  1st byte    0th byte  
  73          6C

  29548 = ls

  So if reg is 29548, run whatever ls is gonna do.


Print:


Directory contents /

/dev


conceptually we need it to store the contents of that directory lol but maybe just have it print something simple first.

Type "hi" and it types "hi!"

hi -> 26984


So we're basically building a dictionary.

Given a value, get a different value.

Command tree?

Store in memory ->
